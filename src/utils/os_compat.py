----------------------
Operating System compatibility patches and workarounds.

This module centralizes OS-specific hacks, event loop policy adjustments,
and platform-dependent workarounds that are required to make the application
run smoothly across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

By isolating these patches in a dedicated utility module, we prevent
OS-level implementation details from cluttering the main application
routing files (e.g., streamlit_app.py) and improve overall code readability.

Issue #2781: Isolate OS-specific asyncio patches.

    Windows-specific patch:
        On Windows, the default ProactorEventLoop can cause issues with
        certain asynchronous libraries (like websockets or database drivers)
        when running inside Streamlit's execution model. This patch forces
        the use of the SelectorEventLoop, which is more compatible with
        Streamlit's threading model on Windows.

    macOS/Linux:
        No patches are currently required for Unix-like systems, as the
        default event loop policies are compatible with Streamlit.

        bool: True if patches were applied successfully, False if they were
              already applied or not needed.
